# Eating-and-Physical-Condition
What are the top indicators of weight levels in individuals based on eating habits and physical condition?

The goal of this project is to identify the top weight level indicators for the surveyed individuals in Columbia, Peru and Mexico.  A null hypothesis I held was 
that eating vegetables has no impact on a person's weight, but given the models' results, we can confidently reject the null hypothesis.
