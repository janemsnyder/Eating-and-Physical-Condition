# Eating-and-Physical-Condition
What are the top indicators of weight levels in individuals based on eating habits and physical condition?

My work is based on a dataset and paper compiled by Fabio Mendoza Palechor and Alexis de la Hoz Manotas.

The goal of my data analysis project is to identify the top weight level indicators for the surveyed individuals in Columbia, Peru and Mexico.  A null hypothesis I held was that eating vegetables has no impact on a person's weight, but given the models' results, we can confidently reject the null hypothesis.
